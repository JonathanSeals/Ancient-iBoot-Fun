# **Ancient-iBoot-Fun**
iOS 5.x iBoot fun for the whole family!

## Support
This example supports only iBoot-1219.62.15 (iOS 5.1/5.1.1) on the iPad 1 (k48ap), iPad 2 WiFi (k93ap), and iPhone 4S (n94ap).
Additional device support can be added for any iOS 5 version, and presumably anything lower as well.

## Usage
This example provides a pdf containing information about the vulnerability, exploit, and how to use the included tools.
To patch a disk image, symlink a target device/version (example: targets/iBoot-1219.62.15/k48) as "target" and run gen.c.

## To-Do
- More device/firmware support
- Cleanup
- Nicer default payload
